# Named Entity Recognition (NER) with Machine Learning

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that identifies entities like people, places, and organizations in text. This project demonstrates NER using Machine Learning.

**Key Steps:**
- **Data Loading:** We load and preprocess the NER dataset.
- **Data Preparation:** Data is transformed for input to a neural network.
- **Model Training:** We create and train a Bidirectional LSTM neural network for NER.
- **Testing the Model:** The trained model is tested on sample text.
